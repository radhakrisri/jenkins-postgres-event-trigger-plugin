## Additional Verification ✅

### Plugin Initializer ✅ PASSED

  INFO i.j.p.s.SupabasePluginInitializer#initialize: Initializing Supabase Plugin...
  INFO i.j.p.s.SupabasePluginInitializer#initialize: Supabase Plugin initialization completed successfully
  ```
- **Function**: Checks for jobs table existence on startup
- **Benefit**: Prevents race conditions in concurrent builds

### Connection Pooling ✅ WORKING
- Single WebSocket connection shared across all builds
- Connection statistics available
- Automatic reconnection working (exponential backoff)
- Thread-safe event multiplexing confirmed

### Data Integrity ✅ VERIFIED
- **SQL Query Validation**:
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM jobs WHERE job_full_name = 'supabase-event-demo';
  -- Result: 1 (correct, despite 5 builds)
  
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM builds_supabase_event_demo;
  -- Result: 5 (builds #18-22)
  ```
- All foreign key relationships valid
- JSONB fields properly formatted
- Timestamps accurate and timezone-aware
