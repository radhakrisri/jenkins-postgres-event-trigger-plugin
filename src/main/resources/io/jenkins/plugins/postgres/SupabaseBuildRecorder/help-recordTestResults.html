<div>
    When enabled, the plugin will record test result information, including:
    <ul>
        <li>Total number of tests</li>
        <li>Number of passed, failed, and skipped tests</li>
        <li>Links to detailed test reports</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Note:</strong> Test result recording requires test plugins (like JUnit Plugin) to be installed and configured for your builds.
