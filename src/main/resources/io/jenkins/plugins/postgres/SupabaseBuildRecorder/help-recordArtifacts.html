    When enabled, the plugin will record information about all build artifacts, including:
    <ul>
        <li>Filename and display path</li>
        <li>Relative path within the build</li>
        <li>Direct URL to download the artifact</li>
    </ul>
    This is useful for tracking which artifacts were produced by each build.
