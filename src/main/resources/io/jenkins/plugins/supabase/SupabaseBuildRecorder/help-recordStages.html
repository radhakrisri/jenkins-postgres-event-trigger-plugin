    When enabled, the plugin will record pipeline stage information for pipeline builds, including:
    <ul>
        <li>Stage names and execution order</li>
        <li>Stage durations and status</li>
        <li>Stage-specific logs and results</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Note:</strong> Full stage information requires the Workflow (Pipeline) plugin to be installed and may need additional configuration.
